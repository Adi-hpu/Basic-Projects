<h2><p align='center'> Sales Prediction From Existing Customer Using Logistic Regression </h2>
Hey, This is my first beginner Project 
<li>
In this project, I explored the basics of:
- Data cleaning ðŸ§¹
- Feature Scaling 
- Model building with regression techniques -Logistic RegressionðŸ“ˆ
- Evaluation of the model's performance ðŸ’¡

I applied what I've learned in Python, using libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib to predict sales based on historical data. The experience was rewarding and a great way to dive into real-world applications of machine learning!
