Hey, This is my first beginner Project. In this Project i am using a dataset having features Age and Salary of Existing Customers data and Predict Whether the new Customer will Buy the Product or not.
In this project, I explored the basics of:<br>
<li> Data cleaning ðŸ§¹<br>
<li> Feature Scaling <br>
<li> Model building with regression techniques -Logistic RegressionðŸ“ˆ
<li> Evaluation of the model's performance ðŸ’¡

I applied what I've learned in Python, using libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib to predict sales based on historical data. The experience was rewarding and a great way to dive into real-world applications of machine learning!
<h3>Requirements(Libraries)</h3>
<li>import pandas as pd<br>
<li>import numpy as np<br>
<li>import seaborn as sb<br>
<li>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>
<li>from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split<br>
<li>from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression<br>
<li>from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score
