<h2><p align='center'> Sales Prediction From Existing Customer Using Logistic Regression </h2>
Hey, This is my first beginner Project. In this Project i am using a dataset having features Age and Salary of Existing Customers data and Predict Whether the new Customer will Buy the Product or not.
In this project, I explored the basics of:<br>
<li> Data cleaning 🧹<br>
<li> Feature Scaling <br>
<li> Model building with regression techniques -Logistic Regression📈
<li> Evaluation of the model's performance 💡

I applied what I've learned in Python, using libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib to predict sales based on historical data. The experience was rewarding and a great way to dive into real-world applications of machine learning!
<h2><li>Requirements(Libraries)</li></h2>
